THE AWS / MOODY INTERNATIONAL
WELDING INSPECTION TECHNOLOGY TRAINING AND
CERTIFIED WELDING INSPECTOR (CWI) EXAMINATION PROGRAMS
THE WELDING INSPECTION TECHNOLOGY (WIT) TRAINING PROGRAM
AWS CERTIFICATION IS THE WELDING INDUSTRY'S MOST
RESPECTED SIGN OF APPROVAL.
MOODYâ€™S AUTHORITATIVE EDUCATIONAL SEMINARS ARE
DESIGNED TO PREPARE YOU FOR THE CWI EXAMINATION.
RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY AS WELDINGSâ€™
LEADING AUTHORITY, THE AMERICAN WELDING SOCIETY,
WORKING TOGETHER WITH MOODY INTERNATIONAL HAVE
DEMONSTRATED THEIR COMMITMENT TO BRING INDUSTRY
THE BEST AND MOST RELIABLE EDUCATIONAL AND
CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS, TAILORED SPECIFICALLY FOR
EACH CIRCUMSTANCE â€” AND THE NEEDS OF THE JOB.
WITH PRACTICAL TRAINING AND PRACTICE EXAMS,
OFFERED DURING THE TRAINING, ATTENDEES CAN BE

PREPARATION NEEDED TO EXPAND THEIR KNOWLEDGE
BASE, IMPROVE THEIR INSPECTION SKILLS, AND WORK
WITH DIVERSE FABRICATION, INSPECTION AND TESTING
CODES, STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS, INDUSTRY-
WIDE.
OUR APPROACH TO EDUCATION AND TRAINING WILL
PROVIDE AN INTENSE WEEK OF PREPARATION THAT WILL
NOT BE FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE. SEMINARS AND
MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES TO
FACILITATE ATTENDEES NEEDS.
THE CERTIFIED WELDING INSPECTOR (CWI) PROGRAM
IF EVERY EMPLOYEE OR CONTRACTOR HIRED CAME WITH
AN OBJECTIVE STAMP OF APPROVAL, WE WOULD NEVER
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT DEPLOYING SOMEONE UNDER-
QUALIFIED AGAIN. BY SPECIFYING PERSONNEL WHO ARE
AWS-CERTIFIED, YOU:
â€¢ MINIMIZE FAILURES AND RECALL.
â€¢ UNIQUELY INCREASE SALES ADVANTAGES OVER
FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC COMPETITION.
â€¢ SAVE MONEY ON TRAINING AND TESTING.
â€¢ MAXIMIZE PRODUCT LIABILITY PROTECTION.
â€¢ MAINTAIN DESIRED LEVELS OF WORKMANSHIP AND
QUALITY, WHILE IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY AND
EFFICIENCY FOR YOUR COMPANY.
SUCCESSFUL EXAM CANDIDATES BECOME AWS CERTIFIED
WELDING INSPECTORS, JOINING AN ELITE GROUP, THAT,
WORLDWIDE, SHARE A DEFINED LEVEL OF PROFICIENCY.
CWIâ€™S ARE ENTERED INTO THE AWS NATIONAL REGISTER
OF CWIâ€™S; RECEIVE A WALLET CARD, CERTIFICATE
SUITABLE FOR FRAMING, AND A UNIQUE STAMP FOR
IDENTIFICATION.
THEY ARE ALSO LISTED IN THE AWS INSPECTION
TRENDS MAGAZINE FOR INDUSTRY REFERENCE AND
VERIFICATION.
THESE DAYS, IT TAKES MORE THAN JUST EXPERIENCE TO
BE SUCCESSFUL. IT TAKES PROOF. PROOF OF YOUR
WORTH AND YOUR ABILITY.
WITH AWS CERTIFICATION, YOU WILL NEVER WORRY
ABOUT LOSING YOUR COMPETITIVE EDGE, SINCE PROOF
OF ACTIVE PRACTICE OR REEXAMINATION IS REQUIRED
AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL OR RECERTIFICATION.
AND YOU WILL JOIN THOUSANDS OF WELDING
INSPECTORS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROGRAM
FOR OVER 25 YEARS.
THE AWS CERTIFIED WELDING INSPECTOR PROGRAM
IS DESIGNED FOR WELDERS, INSPECTORS, TECHNICIANS,
AND ENGINEERS. EARN THE CREDENTIALS YOU NEED

WELDING PROCEDURES FOR WELDS CONTAINING FILLER METAL ADDITIONS, DESIGN AND
PREPARATION OF THE JOINT FOR PRODUCTION WELDING, NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING AND
ACCEPTANCE STANDARDS, AND AUTOMATIC WELDING WITH AND WITHOUT FILLER METAL ADDITIONS.
